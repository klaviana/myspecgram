# myspecgram
short-time Fourier transform implemented in Matlab

% STFT = myspecgram(X, FS, FRAMESIZE, HOPSIZE, DFTSIZE) returns STFT,
% the short-time Fourier transform of the real input signal X (a column)
% using a Hann window FRAMESIZE samples long, skipping HOPSIZE samples
% between frames, and using a DFT length of DFTSIZE. STFT is a matrix
% that is DFTSIZE tall, with columns containing the DFT of the windowed
% signal segments.
%
% myspecgram() also plots an image of the spectrogram, with the time and
% frequency axes labeled in seconds and Hz, respectively, according to
% the input sampling rate FS in Hz.

In this instance, a sample input signal takes the form of a two 1-second-long sinusoids concatenated together at a sampling rate of 8kHz. The first sinusoid has a frequency of 1.0 kHz and the second one has a frequency of 1.2 kHz. White Gaussian noise is added to the concatenated sinusoids.
